# Specification for vCard and QR Code Generation Script

Overview
This script generates vCards and corresponding QR codes based on data provided in a CSV file. Each vCard contains information about a person, and a QR code is generated for each vCard.

Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running:
    
    pip install requests
    
3. Prepare a CSV file named "names.csv" containing the data in the following format: last name, first name, title, email, and phone.
4. Run the script using the following command:
    
    python3 v_cards.py
 

Dependencies
- requests

Input
- CSV file: "names.csv"
  - Format: last name, first name, title, email, phone

Output
The script creates vCard (.vcf) files and QR code (.png) images in the "v_cards" directory.

File Structure
- v_cards.py (replace with the actual name of your Python script)
- names.csv
- v_cards/
  - Generated vCard (.vcf) files
  - Generated QR code (.png) images

Notes
- Ensure proper internet connectivity as the script relies on the Google Charts API to generate QR codes.
