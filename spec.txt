1) OBJECTIVE:

   Generate vcard and qrcode for a list of employees whose the details are provided in a CSV file.



2) INPUT:
   
   2.1) CSV file from which data is extracted needs to be provided as command line argument to load data.
    
   2.2) General format of data provided in CSV file is given below;
           [last_name, first_name, job, email_address, phone_number]

                Morgan, Melinda, Advertising Copywriter, melin.morga@smith_write.com, +71-(391)-2934
                
   2.3) There is a sample CSV file named test_data.csv to test the program. 
              


3. OUTPUT:

   3.1) There will be two output one is the vCard file for each employee and the other is a qr code .png format
        file which can be scanned using a mobile phone camera to get the data regarding an employee.
       
   3.2) qr code data is the same data witten in vCard file format and is generated for each employee. 
        Name of both vCard and qr code files will be the mail-id of employer.

   3.3) Data inside a simple vCard file is of this format:

            Maximum alloted leaves : 20
            Available leaves = 15 



4. EXECUTION:
   4.1) Database to which the data needs to be added should be created manually (postgres is used for databse manipulations)
   
   4.2) The program needs to be executed from command line.
        The CSV file from which the data needs to be extracted should be provided as command line argument when needed to load
        the data.
   
   4.3) Format for providing command line argument and running file is 'python3 <program_file_name> <arguments>' .
   
   4.4) Data will be generated on the folder specified in the program and the direcory to store and data will be created 
        in the folder which the user use for execution of program.
   
   4.5) Execution of arguments:
   
          4.5.1) 
                  
                 python3 v_cards.py -h/--help -> This command provides with help regarding what

                 showing the debug log data for all the file generated. Running without -v/--verbos will show you information 
                 regarding whether the files are generated or not.
                 
                 python3 v_cards.py -d/--dbname -> By default a database name will be present in parser, if the
